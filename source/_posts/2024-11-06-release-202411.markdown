{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.11** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/125)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/699)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/132)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "A. O. Smith" %}

A. O. Smith now provides the hot water status as a percentage rather than low,
medium, or high. The hot water status entity has been updated accordingly.

([@bdr99] - [#127678]) ([documentation](/integrations/aosmith))

[@bdr99]: https://github.com/bdr99
[#127678]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127678

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

Historically, many integrations implemented doorbells as binary sensors with a
device class of occupancy. This design was replaced with the new event entities,
which use a purpose-built device class of doorbell.

HomeKit will no longer automatically link binary sensors with device class
occupancy as a linked doorbell sensor. Linked doorbell sensors can continue
to be configured manually via YAML.

([@bdraco] - [#127668]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#127668]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127668

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

Previously Litter-Robot could use have an off-state. This has now changed to
`docked` as `off` isn't a valid state for `vacuum` entities.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#128297]) ([documentation](/integrations/litterrobot))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#128297]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128297

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Netatmo" %}

The preset modes of the thermostat have been renamed in order to support
translations `Schedule`, `Frost guard` and `Manual` has been renamed to
`schedule`, `frost_guard` and `manual`.

([@piitaya] - [#128890]) ([documentation](/integrations/netatmo))

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya
[#128890]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128890

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Updates" %}

State attributes of update entities have been changed:

- The `in_progress` state attribute is now always a `bool`, never an integer.
- A new state attribute `update_percentage` has been added. The
  `update_percentage` is a number between 0-100 if an update is in progress
  and the entity supports reporting progress, or `None` if an update is not
  in progress or an update is in progress but the entity does not support
  reporting progress.

Scripts, automations, custom frontend components etc. which consume the
`in_progress` state attribute of update entities need to be updated accordingly.
